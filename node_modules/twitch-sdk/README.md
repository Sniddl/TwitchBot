# Twitch Node.js SDK

The Twitch Node.js SDK provides rich functionality for accessing the Twitch API. This includes Twitch Connect, which allows users to bring their Twitch accounts into your application. It is a fork of the official [Twitch JavaScript SDK](http://github.com/justintv/twitch-js-sdk), edited for use with Node.js, IO.js or NW.js.

For a detailed specification of API resources, see the [wiki](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/wiki/API).

## Installation

To install the Twitch SDK into your existing NPM module, simply type `npm install twitch-sdk --save`. This will download the SDK for you to use in your application.

## Loading

To integrate the Twitch JavaScript SDK in your Node application, follow these steps:

First, register a [new client application][]. Record the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you receive in a safe place.

To load and initialize the SDK, add the following code to your main file, filling in the __Client ID__ of your app:

```javascript
var Twitch = require("twitch-sdk");

Twitch.init({clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE'}, function(error, status) {
  // the sdk is now loaded
});
```

You can now perform actions that do not require authorization or have your users log in to Twitch for additional permissions.

### Login

You need a GUI for login to work. As of version **0.3**, this SDK is compatible with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) (formerly *Atom Shell*) and [NW.js](http://nwjs.io) (formerly *node-webkit*).

First, you need to set your redirect URI. Go to the Twitch Connections settings of your app and set the *Redirect URI* to `https://api.twitch.tv/kraken/`. The SDK uses that as the 'dummy' page to retrieve its tokens.

To add login functionality, you need to have the SDK initialized with the GUI.

For **Electron**, you can initialize with the following code:

```javascript
// This code needs to be run in the main process
var Twitch = require("twitch-sdk");

Twitch.init({clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE', electron: true}, function(error, status) {
  // the SDK is now loaded with Electron
});
```

If you want to use **NW.js**, you can initialize the SDK with the following:

```javascript
// This code needs to be run in an existing window.
var gui = require('nw.gui');
var Twitch = require("twitch-sdk");

Twitch.init({clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE', nw: gui}, function(error, status) {
  // the SDK is now loaded with NW.js
});
```

#### Assets

You may use these assets for the Twitch Connect button:

## Core Methods

### Twitch.init

Initialize the Twitch API with your Client ID. This method must be called prior to other actions.

If you want your users to be able to authenticate, you need to use a runtime with a GUI (as of **0.3** the compatible runtimes are Electron and NW.js) to show the login popup and initialize it accordingly.

Also, if your application has a session object stored somewhere, that session can be passed to the init function to speed up the login process.

#### Usage

##### Node.js / IO.js
```javascript
// For use with Node.js or IO.js
// With this, the user cannot authenticate, the application has access to a stored session object.

var status = retrieveStoredSession();

Twitch.init({
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE',
  session: status
}, function(error, status) {
  if (error) {
    // error encountered while loading
    console.log(error);
  }
  // the sdk is now loaded
});
```

##### Electron

```javascript
// For use with an Electron-compatible runtime

var status = retrieveStoredSession();

Twitch.init({
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE',
  session: status,
  electron: true
}, function(error, status) {
  if (error) {
    // error encountered while loading
    console.log(error);
  }
  // the sdk is now loaded
  if (status.authenticated) {
    // user is currently logged in
  }
});
```

##### NW.js

```javascript
// For use with an NW.js-compatible runtime

var gui = require('nw.gui');
var status = retrieveStoredSession();

Twitch.init({
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE',
  session: status,
  nw: gui
}, function(error, status) {
  if (error) {
    // error encountered while loading
    console.log(error);
  }
  // the sdk is now loaded
  if (status.authenticated) {
    // user is currently logged in
  }
});
```

### Twitch.api

Make direct requests to the [Twitch API][] on behalf of your users. This method handles authorization, so any requests you make to the API will automatically be authenticated on behalf of the logged in user.

[Twitch API]: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API

#### Usage

Get the logged-in user's channel stream key:

```javascript
Twitch.api({method: 'channel'}, function(error, channel) {
  console.log(channel.stream_key);
});
```

If the request you wish to make supports optional [parameters] to augment the amount or type of data received, you may add them to your call by adding a 'params' sub-hash:

```javascript
Twitch.api({method: 'streams', params: {game:'Diablo III', limit:3} }, function(error, list) {
  console.debug(list);
});
```
[parameters]: https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/resources/streams.md#parameters

#### API PUT and DELETE example

Some API endpoints require different HTTP methods, you can achieve this using the verb parameter.

```javascript
Twitch.api({method: '/users/:user/follows/channels/:target', verb: 'PUT' }, function([...]) {
  [...]
});
```

## Authentication
The Twitch JavaScript SDK enables your users to log on or register using their Twitch accounts. The SDK handles synchronizing state between your site and Twitch, so users will stay logged in to your app as long as they have a valid access token.

### Twitch.login

Log in a user or request additional permissions. This operation requires a runtime with a GUI to open a login popup, the SDK initialized with the GUI runtime and the *Redirect URI* in the application's Connection settings set to `https://api.twitch.tv/kraken/`.

As opposed to the original version of the SDK, the Node version does not store the authentication token into a session storage, for there is none in Node and as Node modules remain loaded until the application is closed, there is no need for that. The token is simply stored in the memory and is lost upon exiting the application, just like the session storage in browsers.

[DOM Storage]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage#sessionStorage

#### Usage

```javascript
Twitch.login({
  scope: ['user_read', 'channel_read']
});

// TODO: args list, scopes, popups for advanced functionality
```

### Twitch.logout

Reset the session and delete from memory, which is akin to logging out. This does not deactivate the access token given to your app, so you can continue to perform actions if your server stored the token.

#### Usage

```javascript
Twitch.logout(function(error) {
    // the user is now logged out
});
```

### Twitch.getStatus

Retrieve the current login status of a user. Whenever possible, `getStatus` will try to use the stored session for speed. You can force `getStatus` to check the stored session against the API if needed. Your application can store this status object and later initialize the SDK with that object to speed up the login process.

#### Usage

```javascript
Twitch.getStatus(function(err, status) {
  if (status.authenticated) {
    console.log('authenticated!');
  }
});
```

Force an update of the status:

```javascript
Twitch.getStatus({force: true}, function(err, status) {
  if (status.authenticated) {
    console.log('authenticated!');
  }
}
```

### Twitch.getToken

Retrieve the current OAuth token for a user, if one exists. This is useful for persisting an OAuth token to your backend, if there is any.

#### Usage

```javascript
var token = Twitch.getToken()
alert(token)
```

## Events

Most JavaScript-heavy apps use events to be notified of state changes. Some changes might occur due to user actions outside your app's control, so the only way to be notified is through events.

`Twitch.events.addListener` allows you to subscribe to an event:

```javascript
Twitch.events.addListener('auth.login', function(status) {
  // user is logged in
});
```

`Twitch.events.removeListener` allows you to remove listeners for an event:

```javascript
var handleLogin = function(status) {
  alert("you're logged in!");
};

Twitch.events.addListener('auth.login', handleLogin);
Twitch.events.removeListener('auth.login', handleLogin);
```

`Twitch.events.removeAllListeners` allows you to remove all listeners for an event.

### auth.login

This event is emitted when we initialize a session for a user, either because the user filled the login form and created a new session or a valid session had been passed to the init function. The listener is passed the session as a parameter.

### auth.logout

This event is emitted when we no longer have a valid session for a user. This means we either called `Twitch.logout` or the user has revoked access on Twitch for your application.
